## About
Rpaper is a program for making it easier to color windows in your cool and modern GNU/Linux distribution.

Rpaper can split wallpapers into multiple screens, set wallpapers on multiple screens, get a color palette from wallpapers, and apply a color palette to config files.

Rpaper is still **under active development**, so don't be surprised that after the update your wallpaper will burn and the configuration files will be sent to Microsoft servers.
## Features
- uniqueness (analogues of the program are bash scripts with pyval which are very long and tedious to write)
- much faster than bash scripts with pyval
- configurable color pallete generator
- easy to use template system
- written on rust
- idk
